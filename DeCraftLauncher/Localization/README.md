# Creating a DECRAFT Localization

1. Copy `default.txt` and rename it to `<your_language>.decraft_lang`
2. Edit the newly created file with any text editor
3. Copy this file to the `localization` folder in your DECRAFT installation

Your localization should now show up in `Runtime settings` > `Language`.

When you finish a localization, you can PR it to this folder.
